# Macbook-webcam-linux-driver
Script to install webcam driver linux on macbook air

you need to paste the script in your prefered folder and execute in terminal:

  sudo ./webcan_arch (arch base)
  
or

  sudo ./webcan_ubuntu (ubuntu base)

arch and ubuntu options. I tested on Manjaro Gnome, Ubuntu 24.04 and Mint 22.
every time when you update the system, the webcan stoped works. So, you need to reinstall with the script.
