Script to install webcam driver linux on macbook air

You need to paste the script in your prefered folder and execute in terminal:

  sudo ./webcan_arch (arch base)
  
or

  sudo ./webcan_ubuntu (ubuntu base)

Arch and ubuntu options. I tested on Manjaro Gnome, Ubuntu 24.04 and Mint 22 installed on Macbook Air 2013 (x86 archtecture).
Every time when you update the system, the webcan stoped works. So, you need to reinstall with the script.
